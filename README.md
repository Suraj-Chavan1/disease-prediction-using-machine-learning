Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a disease prediction system using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to leverage three different algorithms—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression—to predict the likelihood of a person having a particular disease based on relevant features

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction-ml.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd disease-prediction-ml
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset and place it in the data directory.

Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python predict_disease.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the required information for prediction.

Data
The dataset used for training and testing the models should contain relevant features such as age, gender, medical history, and other factors depending on the targeted disease. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and is available in the data directory.

Algorithms
Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.

Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes. It models the probability of the default class (e.g., having a disease) using the logistic function.

Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the performance of each algorithm in disease prediction.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the project.
